# Global-Terrorism-Analysis

### Introduction
###### The Global Terrorism Database GTD is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2019. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 200,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism START, headquartered at the University of Maryland.


### Characteristics of the Database
###### i)Contains information on over 200,000 terrorist attacks
###### ii)Currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist attacks in the world
###### iii)Efficiently covers attacks between 1970 to 17 September, 2019
###### iv)More than 4,000,000 news articles and 25,000 news sources were reviewed to collect incident data from 1998 to 2019 alone
###### v)The attacks in the GTD are attributed to more than 2,000 named perpetrator organizations

### Project Milestones
###### i)Creating a SQLite database table named "Global_Terrorism" with a defined schema and then importing data from a CSV file named "globalterrorism.csv" into this table using Python's SQLite library.
##### ii)Performing Data cleaning and transformation after loading the rows into the database table from "globalterrorism.csv".
##### iii)Data Exploration with respect to regions, countries and period(1970 to 2019).
##### iv)Creating HeatMap to check the correlation of attributes.
##### v) Implementing Random Forest classifier to predict if casuality will take place given that a terrorist activity has occured in any part of the world with an accuracy of 86.77%

### Key Features of this project
###### Implemented Dynamic Exploratory Data Analysis where we could concentrate on a single country to perform specific analysis.
##### We asked the user to the enter a country name on which the rest of the EDA would change showing specific analysis of that country terrorism.
## Example in this project i have taken the example of Germany.

###### And with respect to Germany all the EDA will be presented.

### Project Goals
###### i)Study the source and do some quick research to understand more about the dataset and its topic
###### ii)Clean the data
###### iii)Prepare the data for processing and analysis
###### iv)Perform data pre-processing to manipulate the data for analysis and draft out targetted tabels for analysis
###### v)Analyze the data more deeply and extract insights
###### vi)Visualize the data using Python and Tableau. Check out the Tableau Workbook on Global Terrorism Analysis.
